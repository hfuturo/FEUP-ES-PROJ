# Test #

To make sure that every feature works as intended, we wrote some tests.

* Unit tests 

    * We used unit tests to make sure that nothing is missing, checking if every page has the expected amount of buttons, icons, images, ...

    * You can see the unit tests [here](../app/test/).

* Acceptance automated tests

    * We had trouble implementing this type of test because the application would reset, but the test would not run.

    * Either way, you can see our acceptance tests [here](../app/test_driver/).
