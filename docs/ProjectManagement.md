## Project Management ##

For this project we used [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/projects/42) to manage our work.

The project has 4 columns: Product Backlog, Iteration Backlog, In Progress and Done.

* <b>Product Backlog</b>: This column is used to store user stories that are yet to be implemented.

* <b>Iteration Backlog</b>: This column is used to store user stories that are going to be implemented in this iteration.

* <b>In Progress</b>: This column is used to store user stories that are currently being implemented in the current iteration.

* <b>Done</b>: This column is used to store user stories that are already implemented.

Each iteration can be seen [here](Hindsight.md).
